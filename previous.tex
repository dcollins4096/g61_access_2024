\section{Previous Success}
\label{sec.previous}

Our team has been using TACC resources since it was under the Teragrid umbrella,
for nearly 20 years.
This past year has been particularly successful.  We have published two papers
on star formation \citep{Collins23, Collins23b}, two papers on turbulence
\citep{Rabatin23, Rabatin23b}, and are nearly finished with the first
of our CMB foreground simulations (Stalpes et al 2023, in prep.)

The two star formation papers have the potential to revolutionize our view of
star formation. We examine the time history of parcels of gas on their way to
becoming stars in a manner never done before.  The first turbulence paper
revisits the density distribution in supersonic turbulence, improving on the
standard lognormal model with one that models the density as a series of shocks.
These simulations were run at the low resolution of $256^3$.
The second turbulence paper was a great success.  We realized that resolution
was key for these studies, so we increased the resolution to $1024^3$, and
examined the correlation between density and velocity.  The supplement to run
these 9 high resolution simulations was requested in February 2023, and the
paper was accepted in July 2023.  The simulations were requested, run, analyzed, and
published in six months.  The exciting CMB foreground results,
discussed earlier, were a suite of moderate resolution that will be extremely
valuable in our understanding of the polarized sky.
