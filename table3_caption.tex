\caption{Detailed accounting for each suite of simulations. The galaxy
simulations are broken down by level for one galaxy.  $N_Z=1.1\sci{9}$ for the turbulence
simulations.  We will use 512 cores for
the galaxy simulations and 4096 cores for the turbulence simulations, using the
whole node (128 cores) for all simulations.}
