\section{Methods}
\label{sec.methods}
The code we will use is Enzo \citep{Collins10,Bryan14}, an open source code that
has been used for a number of astrophysics applications
\citep[e.g.][]{Abel02,CorreaMagnus23}.  Enzo is an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code
that can dynamically add resolution elements as the system requires it, using the
strategy of \citet{Berger89} and \citet{Balsara01}.  We will
use the constrained transport (CT) module \citep{Gardiner05,Collins10} that conserves the
divergence of the field to machine precision.  It uses FFT-based gravity for the
root grid and multigrid relaxation for gravity on fine grids.  The base MHD
solver is a higher order Godunov method.  We will use Grackle \citep{Smith17} to
handle the chemistry and thermodynamics.
