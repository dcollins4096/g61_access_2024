\section{Access to Other Resources}
\label{sec.others}

In addition to our existing Access-Maximize allocation, our team recently
secured 2\sci{5} node-hours on \emph{Frontera} by way of a \emph{Pathways}
allocation.  The \emph{Frontera} allocation will be used to run the high resolution
counterparts to this study.  This includes two turbulence simulations at $2048^3$ and three
galaxies with roughly $512^3$ zones per level.  These mirror the proposed
simulations in form, but are a factor of 8 larger in memory and a factor of 16 more
expensive in SUs.    Thus the \emph{Anvil} simulations will serve to cover
parameter space, while the \emph{Frontera} simulations target specific
configurations with high resolution.  Both are necessary in our quest for a
complete picture of magnetic fields in our Galaxy.  The \emph{Frontera}
allocation cannot be also used for these simulations as the high resolution
($2048^3$ for the turbulence runs and 8 levels of $512^3$ for the galaxy runs)
are quite expensive and will require the whole allocation.
